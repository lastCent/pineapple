## What is it?
Pineapple is a learning tool, designed to be used on the institution level. It's goal is to improve

With Pineapple students will gain the ability to anonymously compare their progress with the rest of
the class. The adaptive exercise and reading material system make sure that improvement comes easily
where it is needed most.
